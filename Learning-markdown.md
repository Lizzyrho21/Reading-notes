# Learning Markdown

## What is markdown?


Markdown is described on [Github Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) as a way to style text on the web. You used general English and special characters to create cool formatting for your code.
-There are a lot of different characters to write for your markdown, but letâ€™s just name a few to get your started.

1. **Headings**
- You can use headings to organize your paragraphs just like you would your research paper or website! Try it below by using: 
â€˜ #Heading â€˜  
Which creates a heading big heading in bold letters. It organizes it as a primary heading. You can also use â€˜##â€™ for a smaller heading and â€˜###â€™ for an even smaller one!

2. **Links**

Creating Links are super easy! just use this format :

'[Sampletext]'(url)' 

just add any text that will show up as a link, and copy and paste the link url in the 'url' parenthesis! ðŸ˜ƒ
