# Choosing a text editor

Having trouble choosing a text editor? 
It can feel pretty daunting to choose the many text editors advertised online, but it makes it easier when you figure out what exactly you need the most.

## NOTE:
What you want to make sure you **avoid using a text editor with no plain text**. These applications have formatting options similar to markdown text. For example, Making bold text, Headings and such without writing code. While it is not impossible to use these applications to code, it is not reccommend for anyone, especially beginners.

##Types of text editors
Since there are many types of text editors, I will only gve you two options that can help you get started on your jouruney as a beginner.

1. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a popular 3rd party text editor that was created by Microsoft. It provides you with a simple workspace and come with extensions to download to help you format and write code faster. It is free to use and you can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com).

2. [Atom](https://atom.io) Atom was created by Github provide just about the same features as VS code. It is beginning friendly and has extensions that you are able to download to write your code more faster and more effeciently. You can downlaod it [here](https://atom.io).
