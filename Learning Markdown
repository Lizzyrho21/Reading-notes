# Learning Markdown

## What is markdown?


Markdown is described on [Github-guides] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) as a way to style text on the web. You used general English and special characters to create cool formatting for your code.
-There are a lot of different characters to write for your markdown, but let’s just name a few to get your started.

1. **Headings**
- You can use headings to organize your paragraphs just like you would your research paper or website! Try it below by using: 
‘ #Heading ‘  
Which creates a heading big heading in bold letters. It organizes it as a primary heading. You can also use ‘##’ for a smaller heading and ‘###’ for an even smaller one!
