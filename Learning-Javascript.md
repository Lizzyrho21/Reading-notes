# Taming the beast- Javascript

Javascript can seem a bit daunting at first, but the more you study and practice the basic syntax, the easier it will become. With that, comes more unraveling of difficult factors, but as long as you can refer back to the basic syntax, you'll be able to build upon your skills!

1.*What is javascript?*
javascipt is a dynmaic programming language thats is complemented by HTML and CSS to create an intereactive webpage. It's always used with non-browser enviroments such as:
- Node.js
- Apache couchDB
-Adobe acrobat 

It is typcially known as "The third layer of the Front-end development cake." it's the one that ties the HTML and CSS together to create some cool looking sites!

2. What **can** it do?
 Javascript consists of:
 - Storing values inside variables 
 -Creating operations on pieces of text
 - Running code in response to user selections.

 **Javascript can run APIs** (Application Programming Interface) In 2 different ways. One being more difficult than the other.
 A. Browser API
 - DOM (Document Object Model) to manipulate HTML and CSS
 -Geographical API to retrive geographical data (online Maps)
 -Canavs and webGL Animated 2d and 3d graphics

B. *3rd party APIs*
- These are not built into browser.
Twitter's API and Google maps API are examples.

3. *Example of Javascript* 
Here is an example of working Javascript into a page. 
A. ALERT (prompting the user)
if we want to prompt the user (create an alert text for the user to intereact with first before accessing the screen) We use the code below :
'alert ("text");'

Happy coding!
