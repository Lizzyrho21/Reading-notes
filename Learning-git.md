#Learning git
Learning git is hard but let's go throught the basics so we can use them as a foundation for learning!

** 1. VERSION CONTROL ** 
To explain git, version control is what we need. Version control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. What that means is we can track, modify, or control what happens with our file. it comes in handy with those ** BIG ** projects at your job.

** 2. Learning GIT **
Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.
It is use pirmarly for:
- tracking changes in a file
- Coordinating work on those files
- Pushing and pulling changes in those files.

** 3. GITHUB **

Git has an open source collaberating website called GITHUB:
-It brings teams together to serve as a network to create repositories (documents) to store the work you and your team have done. using git in your IDE terminal can link your Github page and push/pull repository changes there!

** Happy coding! **
