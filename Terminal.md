# Learning the terminal 

Heya! Ive got a cheat sheet for terminal usage. peep it below! 

 ## 1. [Command line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)
   A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You can open it up in your computer and write to your heart's content. But what do we write in the terminal?
 -Well, when we first open our new friend up, it will display a prompt that looks like this:
 'Usersname :'
 -It will probably display your computer processor and your usersname. That's good! It shows you it's ready to work.
 
## 2. [Basic navigation](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)
How do we navigate from file to file like in our GUI?
Using these different terms can give you an idea of where you are and where you wanna go:
-pwd (print working driectory) Shows you where you are on the command line.
-ls (List) What is in our veiw right now? What are we looking at that we can further direct to?
-cd (change directory) In case we wanna switch to another directory or back to the home directory.

## Paths
-Paths can either be absolute or relative which means that when we regard files or directories we can either be in one of these two paths  **absolute** paths have a location relative to the root directory, while **relative** paths have a relation to where we have landed in our system!

## 3. Files
Files are organizers. they are used to help specify what type of directory or file a file is. here are some different types of files you might see on your computer:
- '.EXE'
- 'TXT'
- 'PNG'

Using **Spaces** In lines helps us to urther specify which file we are looking for!

Happy Coding!
