# Growth Mindset

## What is it?
 The growth mindset is a concept of continuous improvement in an area of study. It is the belief that by perseverance and consistent positive learning methods you can improve in any skill. 
 
## Dangers of the fixed mindset
The fixed mindset is the opposite of the growth mindset. It is the belief that one must be born with a talent or skill and they do not have to learn or relearn any concepts to improve. They are the best at what they do with no explanation. This mindset is a negative one for the people who desire to learn a skill. While everyone is born with talents, there is no reason why you cannot pick up another skill and practice it to the best of your ability.
The fixed mindset  is something that I and even my family have been struggling with for awhile now. I never knew how dangerous it could be until I started college.

I thought I would never be smart enough to solve any problem. I was jealous of my peers for staying ahead of me in certain subjects and thought of my class as a competition. Now, **I see things differently**.

 ### My top 3 areas that I need to keep myself in a growth mindset
 1. Keep all distractions away from you before starting on a project. 
- When signing onto my class, My phone is the biggest issue for directing my attention away from learning the material. My phone must be up and away from my veiw. Even if that means giving my phone to my husband for the day, I must be willing to sacrifice that 2 minutes of phone time for pressing into my leanring material.
~In other words, put it on airplane mode and lock it in your car~

2. Just walk away..?
- I am the best at doing this. Just walk away from a problem and think that everything will be fixed once I return. Uh, yea maybe not. However, there is some truth to this. When I walk away from a website I'm designing or a new coding language i'm learning and i'm about to surrender to it, I just get up and walk away, but not from the problem. Maybe I just sit outside of my patio and take a breath (or a scream) Maybe I can take a 10 minute nap or go out to my favorite coffee spot. As long as I make a commitment to return, My mind will be ready to tackle the problem in a new way. 

3.Ask for help

- Research it, call a peer, message the discord group. Don't be intimidated to how much more they know, but be happy because at least someone has an answer to this unruly problem. Ask them how they got there and write down what you need to know for next time. Rememebr there will ALWAYS be a next time, a next problem, and a next idea. You are not just doing this for you. There is a whole generation behind you that need the solution to the problem you are asking. **ASK** until you're blue in the face.
